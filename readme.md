### 🏙️ TTA-Urban (Transparency, Traceability & Accountability Complaint System)

A digital platform ensuring transparency, traceability, and accountability in resolving urban civic issues.

### 📌 Overview

Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) often struggle with ineffective grievance redressal due to limited accessibility, lack of tracking mechanisms, and poor transparency. Citizens have no visibility into the status of their complaints, and officials lack tools for efficient monitoring and accountability.

This project introduces a technology-driven grievance redressal system that empowers citizens to report civic issues easily and enables municipal authorities to resolve problems efficiently with a complete traceable workflow.

The system uses modern web technologies to ensure:
✔ Transparency – real-time status updates and public dashboards
✔ Traceability – complete complaint lifecycle with timestamps & audit trails
✔ Accountability – role-based access, officer assignment, and SLA-based escalations

### 🎯 Project Objective

To build a smart, accessible, and accountable grievance redressal system that enhances urban governance by integrating digital tools, automation, and data-driven decision-making.

### ✔ What Each Folder Does
Folder	Purpose
src/app	Contains all page routes using the Next.js App Router architecture.
src/components	Holds reusable UI components for cleaner and modular code.
src/lib	Common utilities (API helpers, constants, configs).
public	Stores images, logos, and static files.


### ⚙️ Setup Instructions
🔧 1. Installation

### 📝 Reflection
This folder structure is chosen to:

🔹 Keep the project scalable
Separating components, routes, and utilities prevents clutter as features grow.

🔹 Make teamwork easier
Clear separation means multiple developers can work without conflicts.

🔹 Improve maintainability
A predictable layout makes debugging and updating faster.

🔹 Support future sprints
Upcoming features like dashboards, RBAC, SLAs, and public maps will integrate smoothly because the structure is modular.
